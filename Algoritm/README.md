**1.[Regression Tree](https://github.com/Quan-Sun/Study-Notes/blob/master/Algoritm/1.RegressionTree.ipynb)** - A notebook introduces algorithm of `regression tree` which is a particular kind of nonlinear predictive model. You can understand clearly by reading [this CMU lecture](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/350-2006/lecture-10.pdf).

**2.[C4.5](https://github.com/Quan-Sun/Study-Notes/blob/master/Algoritm/2.C4.5.ipynb)** - A notebook introduces algorithm of `C4.5` which generates classifiers expressed as decision trees. C4.5 adopts information gain ratio as criterion and PEP (Pessimistic Error Pruning, which uses error ratio as criterion) to prune trees. Comparing with ID3 the C4.5 can handle atrributes with continuous values. You can understand clearly by reading [Ross Quinlan web](http://www.rulequest.com/Personal/). If you want to know more about decision tree, I reconmmend [this repo](https://github.com/michaeldorner/DecisionTrees).
